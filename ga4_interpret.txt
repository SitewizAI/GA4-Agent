I gave this query to run:

```
{query}
```

I got this output:

```
{output}
```


Do the following:
1. Output the query executed
2. Output a portion of the results (human readable)
3. Interpret the results in the context of the instructions
4. Output the insights that you have learned
5. Create an action for what you think you should do next using reflection.

If there was an error, output what the error was
